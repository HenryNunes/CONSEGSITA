# CONSEGSITA

CONSEGSITA is a tool created by [CONSEG reaerch group](https://conseg.github.io/) for aplying SITA privacy model[1] upon a dataset. This application run over the data generated by the [Urban Observatory](https://urbanobservatory.ac.uk/) initiative, mantained by Newcastle University. As future work, we intend to make the application domain-independent.

## How does it work

The application receives a given file as input, and values for each of SITA variables (Spatial, Identity, Temporal, and Activity). Each row of the dataset is the processed, according to those values; the output is a file containing the modified data.

## How to run

CONSEGSITA is a JavaFx application. Since Java 11, JavaFx components are no longer part of the standar JDK, so we have to manually configure the development environment. Using [Intelij](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), follow [these instructions](https://stackoverflow.com/a/52470141/6002561).  Other IDEs have similar configuration processes.
